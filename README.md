# Agile-Team-Dev-Assignment_Project
Second Year Agile Team Development Assignment Project (C#, Azure) - First | 74%

This application focused on using Visual Studio to create several C# webpages that retrieves information from an Azure database and allows the user to actively mess with this information such as deleting rows or updating fields. Included are also a variety of test methods designed to test different aspects of the system.

Note: This work was part of a much larger application so may not work as is, however, all code included excluding the bin folder and .config files are my own.
